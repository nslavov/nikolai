# Biography

Nikolai Slavov received undergraduate education from MIT and a doctoral degree from Princeton University for characterizing the coordination of cellular growth with gene expression and metabolism.

He is a Founding Director and CEO of Parallel Squared Technology Institute (<a href="https://www.parallelsq.org/">PTI</a>), and a Professor at Northeastern University. The <a href="http://slavovlab.net">Slavov laboratory</a> pioneered <a href="https://scp.slavovlab.net/methods">experimental</a> and <a href="https://scp.slavovlab.net/computational-analysis">computational</a> methods for single-cell proteomics and used them to connect <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">protein covariation</a> across single cells to functional phenotypes, including macrophage polarization, emergence of drug resistance priming, early mammalian development, and stem cell differentiation. These technologies provided a foundation for establishing [PTI](https://www.parallelsq.org).

Prof. Slavov organizes the annual <a href="https://single-cell.net/">single-cell proteomics conference</a> and contributes to organizing other leading conferences, including NeurIPS.
